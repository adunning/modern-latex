\section{Justification and alignment}

\LaTeX{} is extraordinarily good at justifying text\footnote{Its
only rival here is professional typesetting software like Adobe's.}
for two main reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item It automatically hyphenates words, allowing lines to be broken
    in many more places besides the spaces between
    words.\punckern\endnote{Franklin Mark Liang,
    \textit{Word Hy-phen-a-tion by Com-put-er} (Standford, 1983),
    \url{http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/}.}

\item Instead of considering each line individually,
    \LaTeX{} considers all possible line breaks for a given paragraph,
    then chooses the one that will give the best spacing according to its
    rules.\punckern\endnote{Donald E.~Knuth and Michael F.~Plass,
    \textit{Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines} (Stanford, 1981)}
\end{itemize}

\mbox{However, if \LaTeX{} cannot make a line fit, it sometimes gives up,
overflowing text into the margin.}
This can be remedied somewhat by adding
\verb|\emergencystretch=<width>| to the document's preamble.
If a paragraph can't be broken to \LaTeX's satisfaction,
this command allows it to try one last time,
stretching or shrinking the space in each line by up to the provided
width.\punckern\footnote{\LaTeX{} has pretty sane default limits to how much
it stretches and shrinks spacing in a paragraph.
You probably don't want to make \texttt{<width>} larger than an em or two.}

TODO: Sometimes, you just have to give up and rewrite to make it fit better.

\section{Page breaks}

Talk about how \TeX{} goes page at a time.
Whine a bit.

\section{What next?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Control paragraph spacing, either using the relevant
KOMA~Script options, or with the standalone \texttt{parskip} package.
\item Set the page size and margins with the \texttt{geometry} package.
\item Insert horizontal and vertical space with commands like
    \verb|\vspace|, \verb|\hspace|, \verb|\vfill|, \verb|\hfill|,
    \verb|\enspace|, \verb|\quad|, and \verb|\,|\,.
\item Learn what units \LaTeX{} provides for specifying spacing.
    (We've already mentioned a few here, such as
    \texttt{pt}, \texttt{bp}, \texttt{mm}, and \texttt{in}.)
\end{itemize}
