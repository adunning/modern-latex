\chapter{Layout}

\section{Justification and alignment}

\LaTeX{} is extraordinarily good at justifying text.
Instead of considering each line individually---as most word processors and
web browsers do---it examines all possible line breaks for a given paragraph,
then chooses ones that will give the best overall
spacing.\punckern\endnote{Donald E.~Knuth and Michael F.~Plass,
\textit{Breaking Paragraphs Into Lines} (Stanford, 1981)}
Combined with its ability to automatically hyphenate words,
which allows line breaks in many more places,\punckern\endnote{%
Franklin Mark Liang,
\textit{Word Hy-phen-a-tion by Com-put-er} (Standford, 1983),
\url{http://www.tug.org/docs/liang/}.}
this produces some of the best paragraph layout available.

Sometimes we don't want to justify our text, though.
If you would prefer it be ``flush left''\quotekern,
with a ragged right side, place it in a \texttt{flushleft} environment,
or add \verb|\raggedright| to the current group.
To center it, place it in a
\texttt{center} environment, or add \verb|\centering| to the current group.
And to flush it against the right margin,
use a \texttt{flushright} environment or \verb|\raggedleft|.

\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{flushleft}
This text is flush left with a ragged right edge.
Some prefer this layout since inter-word spacing
is more consistent than it is in justified text.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{center}
This text is centered.
\end{center}

\begin{flushright}
And this text is flush right.
\end{flushright}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
sets
\begin{leftfigure}
\fbox{%
\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
\lm%
\begin{flushleft}
This text is flush left with a ragged right edge.
Some prefer this layout since inter-word spacing
is more consistent than it is in justified text.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{center}
This text is centered.
\end{center}

\begin{flushright}
And this text is flush right.
\end{flushright}
\end{minipage}
}
\end{leftfigure}

\section{Lists}

\LaTeX{} provides three environments for lists:
\texttt{itemize}, \texttt{enumerate}, and \texttt{description}.
In all three, each item starts with an \verb|\item| command.
The \texttt{itemize} environment uses bullets.
With:
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}
\item 5.56 millimeter
\item 9 millimeter
\item 7.62 millimeter
\end{itemize}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
you get
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item 5.56 millimeter
\item 9 millimeter
\item 7.62 millimeter
\end{itemize}
\end{leftfigure}

\bigskip
\noindent The \texttt{enumerate} environment numbers your list:
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect underpants
\item ?
\item Profit
\end{enumerate}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
produces
\begin{leftfigure}
\lm%
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
\item Collect underpants
\item ?
\item Profit
\end{enumerate}
\end{leftfigure}

\bigskip
\noindent The \texttt{description} environment starts each item with some
emphasized text, or \introduce{label}:
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{description}
\item[Alan Turing] was a British mathematician who laid much
    of the groundwork for the field of computer science.
    He is perhaps most remembered for his model of
    general-purpose computing, the Turing machine.
\item[Edsger Dijkstra] was a Dutch computer scientist.
    His contributions in many subdomains---such as concurrency
    and graph theory---are still in wide use today.
\item[Leslie Lamport] is an American computer scientist.
    He defined the concept of sequential consistency,
    which is used to safely communicate between tasks
    running in parallel on multiple processors.
\end{description}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
gives us
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
\lm%
\begin{description}[leftmargin=*]

\section{Page breaks}

Talk about how \TeX{} goes page at a time.
Whine a bit.

\section{What next?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Control paragraph spacing, either using the relevant
KOMA~Script options, or with the \texttt{parskip} package.
\item Set the page size and margins with the \texttt{geometry} package.
\item Customize list formatting with the \texttt{enumitem} package.
\item Insert horizontal and vertical space with commands like
    \verb|\vspace|, \verb|\hspace|, \verb|\vfill|, \verb|\hfill|,
    \verb|\enspace|, \verb|\quad|, and \verb|\,|\,.
\item Learn what units \LaTeX{} provides for specifying spacing.
    (We've already mentioned a few here, such as
    \texttt{pt}, \texttt{bp}, \texttt{mm}, and \texttt{in}.)
\end{itemize}
