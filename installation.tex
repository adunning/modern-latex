\chapter{Installation}
\label{installation}

You install \LaTeX{} on your computer by downloading a \introduce{distribution},
which comes with:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \LaTeX, the program---the thing that turns text files into typeset
    documents.\footnote{We'll actually be installing multiple \LaTeX{} programs,
    but we're getting to that.}
\item A common set of \LaTeX{} \introduce{packages}.
    Packages are pieces of code that can be placed in your documents to
    do all sorts of things, like change their style or add new commands.
    We'll see lots of them in action throughout this book.
\item Miscellaneous tools, such as editors.
\end{enumerate}
Each major operating system has its own \LaTeX{} distribution:
\begin{description}
\item[Mac OS] has Mac\TeX. Grab it from \http{www.tug.org/mactex}
    and follow the instructions there to install it.

\item[Windows] has Mik\TeX.
    Install it from \https{miktex.org/download},
    per the instructions there.
    Mik\TeX{} offers the unique ability to automatically download
    additional packages if your document uses one that it can't find
    on your computer.

\item[Linux and BSD] use \TeX{} Live.
    Like most software, this is provided through your
    \acronym{os}'s package manager.
    Use yours to install \texttt{texlive-\allowbreak core},
    \texttt{texlive-\allowbreak luatex}
    and \texttt{texlive-\allowbreak xetex}.\punckern\footnote{%
    Some Linux distributions (like Arch) package all three into a
    single \texttt{texlive-core} package.}
    As you work with \LaTeX, you may need less-common packages,
    which are usually found in distro packages with names like
    \texttt{texlive-latexextra}, \texttt{texlive-science},
    and so on.\punckern\footnote{Of
    course, package names, and how \LaTeX{} packages are split between
    distro packages, may vary from one Linux distribution to another.
    These names are some of the most common.}
\end{description}

\section{Editors}

Since \LaTeX{} source files are regular text files,
you're free to create them with the usual choices of Vim, Emacs,
Sublime, Notepad\plusplus, and so on.\punckern\footnote{If you have never used
any of these, try a few.
They're popular among programmers and other folks who shuffle text around
screens all day. Just don't use Notepad. Life is too short.}
However, there are also editors designed specifically for \LaTeX{},
which often come with their own built-in \acronym{pdf} viewer.
You can find a fairly comprehensive list on the \LaTeX{} Wikibook,
in its installation chapter. (See Appendix~\ref{resources}.)
