\chapter{Mathematics}

\LaTeX is excellent at typesetting mathematics, both inline with body text,
e.g., $x_n^2+y_n^2=r^2$, and as standalone formulas:
\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)} (a)}{n!} (x - a)^n\]
The former can be created with \verb|$...$| or \verb|\(...\)|,
and the latter with \verb|\[...\]|.
Inside these environments, the rules of \LaTeX{} change:
\begin{itemize}
\item Most spaces and line breaks are ignored completely,
    and the engine usually makes spacing decisions for you based on
    typographical conventions for math.
    \verb|$x+y+z$| and \verb|$x + y + z$| both give you $x+y+z$.
\item Empty lines are not allowed---each formula must occupy a single
    ``paragraph''\quotekern.
\item Letters are automatically italicized, as they are assumed to be variables.
\end{itemize}
To return to normal ``text mode'' inside a formula, use the \verb|\text| command.
Other formatting commands mentioned in \chapref{formatting} work as well.
From
\begin{leftfigure}
\begin{lstlisting}
\[\text{fake formulas} = \textbf{annoyed mathematicians}\]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{leftfigure}
we get:
\[\text{fake formulas} = \textbf{annoyed mathematicians}\]

\section{What next?}

This chapter is egregiously short.
Typesetting mathematics is arguably the raison d'Ãªtre of
\LaTeX,\punckern\footnote{Well, \TeX} but the topic is so broad that giving
it fair coverage would take up half the book.
Here, more so than anywhere else,
you owe it to yourself to find some real references and learn what the system
is capable of.
