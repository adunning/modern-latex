\chapter{A Brief History of \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX}}
\label{history}

Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term \emph{analysis of algorithms} in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
\textit{The Art of Computer Programming}.

When the first volume of \acronym{taocp} was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with \introduce{hot metal} type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.
These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of \acronym{taocp}, volume~2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn't provide the same level of quality he had come to
expect.\punckern\endnote{Donald E.~Knuth, \textit{Digital Typography} (Stanford, 1999), 3--5.}

The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves\footnote{Programmers
often refer to seemingly unrelated tasks needed to solve their main problem
as ``yak shaving''\quotekern. The phrase is thought to originate from an episode
of \textit{The Ren~\&~Stimpy Show}.\endnote{``yak shaving''\quotekern,
\textit{The Jargon File},
\url{http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html}.}}
of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
\TeX.\punckern\footnote{\TeX\ is pronounced like the first syllable of
``\textbf{tech}nician''\quotekern. It is short for the Greek
{\fontspec[Scale=MatchLowercase]{Linux Libertine}τέχνη},
meaning \introduce{art} or \introduce{craft}.\endnote{Knuth,
\textit{The \TeX book} (Addison-Wesley, 1986), 1.}}

It's hard to appreciate how much of a revolution \TeX\ was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe's \acronym{pdf} wouldn't exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, \acronym{dvi}.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
\MF, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.\punckern\footnote{In some ways,
\MF\ is more impressive than the PostScript system that
underpins modern TrueType and OpenType font files.
Instead of constructing characters from lines and curves,
\MF\ uses strokes of virtual pens.
By tweaking the parameters of these pens and strokes, one can build entire
font families from the same base designs.}
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.\footnote{Called the Knuth-Plass and
Knuth-Liang algorithms,
these form the basis of \TeX-based layout systems to this day,
and went on to influence the algorithms Adobe uses in its software.\punckern\endnote{%
Several sources (\url{http://www.tug.org/whatis.html},
\url{https://tug.org/interviews/thanh.html},
\url{http://www.typophile.com/node/34620})
mention \TeX's influence on the \textit{hz}-program by Peter Karow
and Hermann Zapf, thanks to via Knuth's collaborations with Zapf.
\textit{hz} was later acquired by Adobe and used in part
when creating their paragraph formatting systems for InDesign.}}

\LaTeX{}, short for Lamport~\TeX{}, was developed as a set of commands
for common document layouts by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s.
It was introduced in 1986 with Lamport's guide,
\textit{\LaTeX: A Document Preparation System}.
Other typesetting systems based on \TeX{} also exist,
the other most popular today being Con\TeX{}t.

Development continues today,
both in the form of user-provided packages for \TeX{} and \LaTeX{},
and on improvements to the \TeX{} typesetting program itself.
Currently, there are four projects:
\begin{description}
\item[\TeX] is the original system by Donald Knuth.
Knuth stopped adding features after version 3.0 in March~1990,
and all subsequent releases have contained only bug fixes.
With each release, the version number asymptotically approaches $\pi$
by adding an additional digit.
The most recent version, 3.14159265, came out in January~2014.

\item[pdf\TeX] is an extension of \TeX{} that provides direct \acronym{pdf}
    output (instead of the \TeX's \acronym{dvi}),
    native support PostScript\footnote{Specifically, PostScript Type 1}
    and TrueType fonts,
    and micro-typographic features discussed in this book's Microtype chapter.
    It was originally developed by Hàn Thê Thành as part of his PhD thesis
    for Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic.\punckern\endnote{%

\end{description}

Building \TeX{} today is an\ldots{} interesting endeavour.
When it was written in the late 1970s,
there were no large, well-documented open-source projects for students to study,
so Knuth set out to make \TeX{} into one.
As part of this effort, \TeX{} was written in a style he calls
\introduce{literate programming}: opposite most programs---where
documentation is interspersed throughout the code---Knuth wrote \TeX{} as a book,
with the code interspersed between paragraphs.
This mix of English and code is called \texttt{WEB}.\punckern\footnote{Knuth
also released a pair of compainion programs named
\texttt{TANGLE} and \texttt{WEAVE}.
The former extracts the book---as \TeX, of course---and the latter
produces the original Pascal source code.}

Unsurprisingly, most modern systems don't have good tooling for a late 1970s
dialect of Pascal that \TeX{} was written in,
so present-day distributions use another program,
\texttt{web2c}, to convert \TeX{}'s \texttt{WEB} source into C code.
The resulting C is then built with a system's standard toolchains.
