This guide was typeset using \LuaLaTeX{} in Adobe Garamond Pro by
Robert Slimbach.
His revival is based on the Roman type of
the \otford{16}{th} century French
punchcutter Claude Garamond.
Italics are inspired by work of Garamod's contemporary Robert Granjon.
A few glyphs---such as the historical long s---were borrowed from
Georg Duffner's EB~Garamond.

Monospaced items are set in Matthias Tellen's
\href{https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/}{\texttt{mononoki}},
a typeface designed to work well on both low-resolution computer monitors
and in high-resolution print.

Captions are set in
\href{http://www.fontbureau.com/NHG/}{\textsf{\small Neue Haas Grotesk}},
a Helvetica restoration by Christian Schwartz.
Other digitizations of the classic Swiss typeface are based on fonts made for
Linotype and phototypesetting machines,
resulting in digital versions with all the compromises and kludges from those
past two generations of printing technology.
Schwartz based his work on Helvetica's original drawings,
producing a design faithful to the original cold metal type.

{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX, Scale=MatchLowercase]{Futura-Boo}URW Futura}
makes a few guest appearances.
Originally released in 1927 by Paul Renner,
Futura has found itself almost everywhere,
from advertising and political campaigns to the moon.
Douglas Thomas's recent history of the typeface,
\textit{Never Use Futura}, is a fantastic read.

Various bits of non-Latin text are set in
{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX,Scale=MatchLowercase]{NotoSerif-Regular}Noto},
a type family by Google that covers \emph{every} language
in the Unicode standard.

Finally,
{\lm Latin Modern}---the OpenType version of Knuth's Computer Modern used throughout
the book---as well
as {\fontspec[Scale=MatchUppercase]{TeX Gyre Termes}\TeX{} Gyre Termes}---the
free alternative to Times Roman seen on page \pageref{typography}---are from
the digital type foundry of Grupa Użytkowników Systemu \TeX{},
the Polish \TeX{} Users' Group.
