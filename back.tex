\section{For \texorpdfstring{\LaTeX}{LaTeX}}

As promised at the start, this book is incomplete.
To keep things short,
entire \LaTeX{} features---like figures, captions, references,
and graphics---haven't been mentioned.
Use some of these resources to fill in the gaps,
or as more thorough references:

\section{For typography}

We've spent most of our time here focusing on questions of \emph{what}
you can do with \LaTeX,
and little on \emph{how} you should use it to create quality typography.

This guide was typeset with \LuaLaTeX{} in Garamond Premier by Robert Slimbach.
His revival is based on Roman type by
\otford{16}{th} century French
punchcutter Claude Garamond.
Italics are inspired by the work of Garamod's contemporary Robert Granjon.

Monospaced items are set in Matthias Tellen's
\href{https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/}{\texttt{mononoki}},
a typeface designed to work well on both low-resolution computer monitors
and in high-resolution print.

Captions are set in
\href{http://www.fontbureau.com/NHG/}{\textsf{\small Neue Haas Grotesk}},
a Helvetica restoration by Christian Schwartz.
Other digitizations of the classic Swiss typeface are based on fonts made for
Linotype and phototypesetting machines,
resulting in digital versions with all the compromises and kludges from those
past two generations of printing technology.
Schwartz based his work on Helvetica's original drawings,
producing a design faithful to the original cold metal type.

{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX, Scale=MatchLowercase]{Futura-Boo}URW Futura}
makes a few guest appearances.
Originally released in 1927 by Paul Renner,
Futura has found itself almost everywhere,
from advertising and political campaigns to the moon.
Douglas Thomas's recent history of the typeface,
\textit{Never Use Futura}, is a fantastic read.

Various bits of non-Latin text are set in
{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX,Scale=MatchLowercase]{NotoSerif-Regular}Noto},
a type family by Google that covers \emph{every} language
in the Unicode standard.

Finally,
{\lm Latin Modern}---the OpenType version of Knuth's Computer Modern used throughout
the book---as well
as {\fontspec[Scale=MatchUppercase]{TeX Gyre Termes}\TeX{} Gyre Termes}---the
free alternative to Times Roman seen on page \pageref{typography}---are from
the digital type foundry of Grupa Użytkowników Systemu \TeX{},
the Polish \TeX{} Users' Group.
