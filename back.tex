\chapter{Colophon}

This guide was typeset using \LuaLaTeX{} in Adobe Garamond Pro by
Robert Slimbach.
His historical revival is based on the Roman type of
the 16{\addfontfeature{VerticalPosition=Superior}th} century French
punchcutter Claude Garamond.
Italics are based on the work of his contemporary Robert Granjon.

Monospaced items are set in Matthias Tellen's
\href{https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/}{\texttt{mononoki}},
a typeface designed to work well on both low-resolution computer monitors
and in high-resolution print.

Captions are set in
\href{http://www.fontbureau.com/NHG/}{\textsf{\small Neue Haas Grotesk}},
a Helvetica restoration by Christian Schwartz.
Other digitizations of the classic Swiss typeface are based on versions made for
Linotype and phototypesetting machines,
resulting in digital fonts with all the compromises and kludges from the past two
generations of printing technology.
Schwartz based his work on Helvetica's original drawings,
resulting in a design faithful to the original cold-metal type.

{\fontspec[Ligatures=TeX, Scale=MatchLowercase]{Futura-Boo}URW Futura}
makes a guest appearance
for typographical examples on page \pageref{typography}.
Originally released in 1927 by Paul Renner,
Futura has found itself almost everywhere,
from advertising and political campaigns to the moon.
Douglas Thomas's recent history of the typeface,
\textit{Never Use Futura}, is a fantastic read.

Finally,
Latin Modern---the OpenType version of Knuth's Computer Modern---as well
as {\fontspec[Scale=MatchUppercase]{TeX Gyre Termes}\TeX{} Gyre Termes}---a
free alternative to Times Roman seen on page \pageref{typography}---are from
the digital type foundry of Grupa Użytkowników Systemu \TeX{},
the Polish \TeX{} Users' Group.
